# Irisia GUI

Irisia GUI is a GUI framework based on Rust programming language, featured high-performance, cross-platform, flexible, empowers everyone to build an morden applications with accuracy and efficiency.

Irisia is heavily depend on following crates:

- [winit](https://crates.io/crates/winit): A window launcher, which is widely used in Rust.
- [skia-safe](https://crates.io/crates/skia-safe): Bindings to [Skia](https://skia.org/). Skia is a graphics library developed by Google, used by lots of project, most famously Chrome and Android.
- [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio): A asynchronous library with runtime and useful utils, which is high-speed and reliable.

## üëÄ Take a quick look

A simple window application demo(located at [examples/simple_window.rs](https://github.com/Fancyflame/irisia-rs/tree/main/examples/simple_window.rs)) is looks like following. Newest examples please take a look at
[examples](https://github.com/Fancyflame/irisia-rs/tree/main/examples) directory.
