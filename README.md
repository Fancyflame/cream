# Irisia GUI

Irisia GUI is a Rust-based GUI framework, featured high-performance, cross-platform, flexible, empowers everyone to build modern applications with accuracy and efficiency.

Irisia is heavily depend on following crates:

- [winit](https://crates.io/crates/winit): A window launcher, be widely used in Rust.
- [skia-safe](https://crates.io/crates/skia-safe): Bindings to [Skia](https://skia.org/). Skia is a graphics library developed by Google, used by lots of project, most famously Chrome and Android.
- [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio): A asynchronous library with runtime and useful utils, high-speed and reliable.

**Irisia GUI is currently under rapid development, the documentation, API, and examples may not reflect the latest progress. To obtain the most up-to-date features, please refer to `windows.rs` file.**

**Irisia GUI正处于快速开发阶段，文档、接口和示例很可能不能反应最新进度。欲获知最新特性，可参考`windows.rs`文件。**

# example暂时无法使用
因为在制作缓存模型，涉及大量渲染逻辑，因此example暂时没法运行。**可以运行缓存模型前一个版本的例程来快速体验irisia**。
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Fancyflame/irisia-gui.git
cd irisia-gui
git reset --hard f332664 # 回退到之前版本
cargo r --example window
```

## 📕 Irisia Book

Only Chinese is available now\
目前只有中文可用

## 📊 Progress
The progress is now at *cache model*. Designing this part is time consuming, because cache model is closely
related to the animation system and the way elements rendering.

目前进度在“缓存模型”。设计这部分是很耗时的，因为缓存模型和动画系统以及元素渲染方式密切相关。

## 🌍 About English Documentation

- We are sorry but due to my(or our) limited English proficiency, documentation is not available now. We will add as soon as possible.
- How about take a look at [`window`](https://github.com/Fancyflame/irisia-rs/blob/main/examples/window.rs) example?
- If you tend to translate the documentation into English, please feel free to open an issue to let me(us) know. Thanks a lot.
- **If you in need of English documentation, also please open an issue to let us know!**

## 👀 Take a quick look

A simple window application demo(located at [examples/simple_window.rs](https://github.com/Fancyflame/irisia-rs/tree/main/examples/simple_window.rs)) is looks like following. Newest examples please take a look at
